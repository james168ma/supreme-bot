5. Download your chromedriver for your OS and version from [here](http://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads), move it into the current directory, and unzip it with: `unzip <zip file>`
6. Create your `config.py` file:

```
num_items = <number of items you want>
keys = [
	{

            "specific_url": "<specific_item_link>" || None,

	    # Keep url the same
            "url": "https://www.supremenewyork.com/shop/all/",

	    # the number of the item as seen in the layout on the shop/all page (second row starts at 8) 
            "item_number": <number>,

`	    # only fill out item_type if you have item type, name, and style/color wanted; otherwise replace with None
            "item_type": "<type>" || None,
            "item_name": "<name>",
            "style": "<style>",

	    # fill these with your own
            "name": "<name>",

            "cc_number": <card_number>,
            "exp_month": <month_number>, # 1 is January, 12 is December

            "cvv": <cvv_number>
	},
	{
	  <another key list here following the same format>
	},
	{
	  <create the same amount of key lists as num_items you specified above>
	}
]
```
An example `config.py` file for reference:
```
num_items = 2
keys = [
